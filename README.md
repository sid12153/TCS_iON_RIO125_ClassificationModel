# TCS_iON_RIO125_ClassificationModel
This is the repository containing my Internship Project with TCS iON RIO-125.
In this project, a dataset, which is in the form of .csv file is used. 
I have used Google Colab to build a Machine Learning Model in Python language to perform analytics and classify the severity of medicinal drugs based on data provided.
Data preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis is performed. The code of Milestones and Final code written by me are provided in repository.
Dataset used is also provided. 
The Classification Algorithms used are SVM Classifier, Random Forest CLassifier, Naive Bayes Classifier, Logistic Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbours and Decision Tree Classifier.
The Accuracy of each classifier is also calculated.
